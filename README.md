# Comparative Study of Some Popular Streaming Platforms

In the following report, we examine content trends across three major streaming platforms in India: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar. 

The analysis covers a wide range of topics, such as age rating, genres, and content distribution. It was found that all the platforms have a significantly higher number of movies than TV shows, with Netflix and Prime Video focusing more on mature content, whereas Hotstar is more focused on family-friendly content. Further analysis shows drama and comedy emerging as the top two most popular genres across all the platforms. A word cloud analysis of movies and TV show descriptions showed common themes of life, love, and family. A year-wise study shows that a greater proportion of movies is being released than TV shows, and regression plots suggest a downward trend in both movie running times and the number of TV show seasons over time, indicating audience favouritism towards short-form content. 

Overall, the report explores how every platform caters to the Indian streaming market by constantly adapting to changing trends and consumer demands.
